# Amazon-Project
A responsive Amazon-inspired homepage using only HTML and CSS. The page focuses on layout structure, navigation bar design, product sections, and visual styling without using JavaScript. This project demonstrates my understanding of semantic HTML, CSS layouts, flexbox/grid, and clean UI design.
